README 2.0

This program is an expantion of my original file terminal program. It's functionality is explained within the program itself through the "?" and "help" commands. This expantion centers specifically on simple encryption and decryption functions.

Both of the bonus parameters of this assignment are implemented. As mentioned before, the encryption and decryption functions were implemented inside my file terminal program from the last assignment. The program will also list all files in the directory with the "directory" command. Those files can then be read with the "read <fileName>" command.
