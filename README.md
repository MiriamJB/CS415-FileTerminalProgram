Hello! This is a project for my CS 415 class. This program fulfills all the following requirements:

Assignment Overview
This individual assignment/activity aims to develop your skills in file manipulation, user interface design, error handling, and problem-solving. It provides an opportunity to showcase your knowledge of C++ programming and to stretch your abilities by implementing bonus features.

Assignment Description
In this assignment, you will be tasked with creating a file terminal program in C++. The program should provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to perform various file operations such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting files. You will also have the opportunity to include bonus features to stretch your skills and enhance the functionality of your program.

Assignment Requirements

   - Display appropriate error messages to guide the user in case of errors.

3. User Interface:
   - Design a user-friendly interface that presents the available file operations and prompts the user for input.
   - Use appropriate text prompts and messages to guide the user through the program.

4. Menu System:
   - Implement a menu system that allows the user to select the desired file operation from a list of options.
   - Ensure that the menu system is easy to navigate and provides a clear understanding of available choices.

5. File Content:
   - Enable reading and writing of file content, allowing the user to modify or view the content of a file.

6. Code Organization and Documentation:
   - Organize your code into functions or classes to improve modularity and readability.
   - Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance code understanding.
   - Include comments to explain essential sections of your code.

7. Testing:
   - Test your program with different scenarios and file operations to ensure it works as expected.
   - Consider edge cases and handle potential errors gracefully.
